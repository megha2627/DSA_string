Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
 word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.


class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
       
        
          String[] arr = s.split("\\s+");
          int k=arr.length;
          int j=0;
          String s2="";
        for(int i=k-1;i>=0;i--){
            
          s2=s2+arr[i]+" ";
        }
          
        String s1=s2.trim();
       
        return s1;
        
    }
